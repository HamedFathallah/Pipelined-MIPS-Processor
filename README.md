# Pipelined-MIPS-Processor
pipelined mips processor with hazard control unit

we wrote verilog description:<p>the veilog (hard ware description language) of the MIPS-pipline and how the hazards are controlled.</p>

## our verilog supports:add,or,..........

<p> our verilog code can be found in partitions folder in source and the integration version is pipelined_mips_in_verilog.v </p>

we aslo made a web-based-gui that describes system

and we made our assembler that take assembly code and convert it to binary and write it in file that will be run by modelsim

## How to Run
-for the hardware (verilog) code you will need to copy it in modelsim or xilion and debug in it
-for the web-based gui you need to have xammp and copy file and rename it to index.php then run from local-host .
-for assembler take code and compile it (it is made by c++).
